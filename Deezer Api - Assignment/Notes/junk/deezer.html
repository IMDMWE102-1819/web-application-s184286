<p> 4) The visual design of the application is less important than the technical implementation ï¿½ but it is still something that you must consider,
    you may want to look at a front-end framework such as Bootstrap to provide some styling elements for you.

<!--
<p>  Considerations: </p>

<p>
    The site must be responsive and demonstrate considerations towards accessibility and usability.
    The HTML and CSS you write should validate with very few errors or issues
    and you must demonstrate some testing between different browsers and devices.
    Any JavaScript should be well commented, with sensible names used for variables and functions.
</p>

<p>
    Submission The GitHub commit made prior to or at noon on the 4th January 2019 will be used as your final submission.
    Any further commits to the project will be ignored for the purposes of assessment.
